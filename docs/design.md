# Incremental Sheep Design Doc

## General idea

An incremental game that tracks the rise of civilization, with each prestige loop offering major changes to the gameplay and reducing the need to re-run the early parts of the game.

## Structure of the game

Main loop is creation of an industrial network of buildings, which produce and transform multiple types of resources. Limitations being both storage and processing speed, in order to promote visiting the game occassionally over the course of the day.

Peripheral loops can take multiple forms, changing from era to era.
