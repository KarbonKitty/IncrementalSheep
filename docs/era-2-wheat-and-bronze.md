# Era 2 - Wheat and bronze

## General idea

Middle Stone Age to early Bronze Age, including formation of permanent settlements, development of agriculture, and invention of bronze.

Agriculture and settlements mean that the main intereset in this era will move from sheep and their jobs to the buildings and industrial-like processes.

## Real-life inspirations

### Technological progress

Improved stone tools, early copper and then bronze tools (and weapons)?

Agriculture and cooking

### Diet

### Culture and society

### Construction

## Game design considerations

### Population

Population can't be counted in single sheep any more, but probably no need to change mechanics yet - consider each sheep an abstraction for the entire family.

Main food source is now agriculture, and hunting will lose prominence (as more expansive agriculture wil reduce the hunting effectivness while increasing food security).

Housing will be a major consideration.

### Knowledge

Folklore will still be the main mechanics.

### Culture/religion

This will probably get implemented during 4th major iteration, as this is going the be the main theme for the fourth era.

### Warfare
